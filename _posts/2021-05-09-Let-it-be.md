## Let it be...
This poem has no ego,  
But the writer has,  
This poem can be anything,  
but the writer wants it to be,
something,   
if someone around you,  
if some-events around you,  
remind you of her,  
Let this be a safe space,  
If you can't sleep well,  
If you miss the comfort,  
Let this be warmth,  
If the world has weathered you down,  
brought you down to your knees,  
If you have started to,  
consider this world,  
as a one player game,  
Let this be your comrade,  
If you can't find someone,  
to talk today,  
to cry your heart out,  
that you miss her,  
let this be your confession,    
If you think you are insignificant,
you are,  
But Let this poem be a mirror,  
where you can see the cosmos,  
The poem has no ego,  
But the writer has.
