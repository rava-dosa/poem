## Not all heart 

It's a truth,  
Not all heart,  
Are made,  
Same,  
Not all heart,  
Feel the,  
Same,  
Not all heart,  
has the Liberty,  
to Love,  
to Feel,  
to Fly,  
It's our heart,  
It's our fight,  
It's a truth,  
Not all heart,  
Not all heart,  
will be understood,  
even by those,  
who manufactured,  
it,  
it,  
it,  
Not all heart,  
will feel much,  
Not all heart,  
Are made,  
Same,  
Keep your heart,  
Keep you heart safe,  
Keep your heart alive,  
Let it feel,  
Keep Feeling,  
Even When,  
It pains,  
Because Not all Heart,  
Are made Same,  
When the moment,  
the moment is Right,  
I promise,  
It will be,  
Free,  
Just Remember,  
It's our fight,  
And Not All Heart,  
Are Made,  
Are Same.
